# uppercase-letter-lookup-table-builder
This program builds the lookup table for rphsoftware/uppercase-letter-detection to use.

You need the unicode consortium's ucd.all.flat.xml file (you can download it from https://unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucdxml/ucd.all.flat.zip and unpack the zip)

After that, just run the program with that file next to the binary and you will get a 136 kb lookup table for the uppercase-letter-detection program.
